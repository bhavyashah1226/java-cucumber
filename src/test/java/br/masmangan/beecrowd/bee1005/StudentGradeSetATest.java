"""
  Scenario 1: Valid double value set as 'A' grade
  Details:
    TestName: testValidDoubleForA.
    Description: This test checks the method setA to verify that it accepts valid double input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set value of b.
    Act: Call the method setA with a valid double number.
    Assert: Use the getAverage method to assert that the average properly accounts for the value of 'a'.
  Validation:
    This test makes sure the setA method properly sets the value of 'a'. Thus, when the getAverage is called, it reflects the correct calculation using the set 'a' and 'b' values. Hence, it is very significant in ensuring accurate grade calculations.

  Scenario 2: Negative double value set as 'A' grade
  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeDoubleForA.
    Description: This test checks that setA rejects negative double input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set value of b.
    Act: Call the setA method with a negative double number.
    Assert: The method should throw an appropriate exception or return an error message.
  Validation:
    Grades can't be negative, and this test checks proper handling of such invalid cases by the setA method. It's critical for data integrity and user experience.

 Scenario 3: Double max value set as 'A' grade
  Details:
    TestName: testDoubleMaxForA.
    Description: This test checks that setA handles the maximum double value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set value of b.
    Act: Call the setA method with the maximum double value.
    Assert: Characteristic issues associated with floating point arithmetic should not affect the outcome of the calculation, and no OverflowException should be thrown.
  Validation:
    This test is significant in ensuring that the setA method properly handles extreme values, which is essential for robust and reliable software.
Scenario 4: Double min value set as 'A' grade
  Details:
    TestName: testDoubleMinForA.
    Description: This test checks that setA handles the minimum double value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade and set value of b.
    Act: Call the setA method with the minimum double value.
    Assert: Characteristic issues associated with floating point arithmetic should not affect the outcome of the calculation, and no UnderflowException should be thrown.
  Validation:
    This test is significant in ensuring that the setA method is robust enough to handle abrupt scenario such as setting the minimum value for 'A' grade which is crucial for robust and reliable software.
