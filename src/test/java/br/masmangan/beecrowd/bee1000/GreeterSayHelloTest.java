Here are your existing test cases which we found out and are not considered for test generation:

File Path: /var/tmp/Roost/RoostGPT/bedrockConnTest/0ce41dac-ec22-4c09-86d4-fa355c0092ba/source/java-cucumber/src/test/java/br/masmangan/beecrowd/bee1000/GreeterSteps.java
Tests:
    "@Test
@When("greeting is done")
@When("uma saudação é feita")
public void greeting_is_done() {
    actual = g.sayHello();
}
"Scenario 1: Test sayHello method returns expected string

Details:
  TestName: sayHelloReturnsExpectedString
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello method returns the correct string "Hello World!".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Greeter class.
  Act: Call the sayHello method on the Greeter instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from sayHello is equal to "Hello World!".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello method is working as expected by returning the correct greeting string. This test is essential to ensure the basic functionality of the Greeter class.

Scenario 2: Test sayHello method returns non-null value

Details:
  TestName: sayHelloReturnsNonNullValue
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello method returns a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Greeter class.
  Act: Call the sayHello method on the Greeter instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from sayHello is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello method does not return a null value, which could potentially cause a NullPointerException in the application. This test helps ensure the method's robustness and prevents potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Test sayHello method with different instances

Details:
  TestName: sayHelloWithMultipleInstances
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello method returns the expected string for multiple instances of the Greeter class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of the Greeter class.
  Act: Call the sayHello method on each instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from sayHello is equal to "Hello World!" for each instance.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello method behaves consistently across multiple instances of the Greeter class. This test helps ensure the method's reliability and predictability, even when multiple objects are created and used simultaneously.

Scenario 4: Test sayHello method with concurrent access

Details:
  TestName: sayHelloWithConcurrentAccess
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello method can handle concurrent access from multiple threads without causing any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Greeter class and set up a thread pool.
  Act: Submit multiple tasks to the thread pool, each calling the sayHello method on the Greeter instance.
  Assert: Assert that all tasks complete successfully without any exceptions or unexpected behavior.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello method is thread-safe and can handle concurrent access from multiple threads without causing any race conditions or other concurrency-related issues. This test is important if the Greeter class is intended to be used in a multi-threaded environment.

Note: Since the provided code does not include any additional classes or dependencies, the test scenarios are limited to the basic functionality of the sayHello method. In a real-world scenario, more comprehensive testing would be required to cover different aspects of the application, such as error handling, edge cases, and interactions with other components or external dependencies.
