"Scenario 1: Test getProduct with positive integers

Details:
  TestName: validProductOfPositiveIntegers
  Description: Verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set values for a and b as positive integers.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned product is equal to the expected result.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method correctly multiplies two positive integer values. This test ensures the basic functionality of the getProduct method in a typical use case.

Scenario 2: Test getProduct with negative integers

Details:
  TestName: validProductOfNegativeIntegers
  Description: Verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set values for a and b as negative integers.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned product is equal to the expected result.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method can handle negative integer values and calculate their product correctly. This test covers a common use case where the input values can be negative.

Scenario 3: Test getProduct with one positive and one negative integer

Details:
  TestName: validProductOfPositiveAndNegativeIntegers
  Description: Verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of one positive and one negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set value for a as a positive integer and value for b as a negative integer (or vice versa).
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned product is equal to the expected result.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method can handle a combination of positive and negative integer values and calculate their product correctly. This test covers a use case where the input values have different signs.

Scenario 4: Test getProduct with zero as one of the operands

Details:
  TestName: productWithZeroAsOperand
  Description: Verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product when one of the operands is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set value for a as zero and value for b as a non-zero integer (or vice versa).
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned product is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles the case where one of the operands is zero, resulting in a product of zero. This test covers an edge case where one of the input values is zero.

Scenario 5: Test getProduct with maximum and minimum integer values

Details:
  TestName: productWithMaxAndMinIntegerValues
  Description: Verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product with maximum and minimum integer values without causing an overflow or underflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set value for a as Integer.MAX_VALUE and value for b as Integer.MIN_VALUE (or vice versa).
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned product is equal to the expected result.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method can handle extreme integer values without causing an overflow or underflow. This test covers edge cases where the input values are at the boundaries of the integer range.

Note: These test scenarios cover various cases for the getProduct method, including positive and negative integers, edge cases with zero and extreme values, and combinations of positive and negative operands. However, additional tests may be needed to cover other edge cases or specific requirements based on the application's domain and business logic.
