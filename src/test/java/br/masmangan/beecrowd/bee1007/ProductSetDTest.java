Scenario 1: Test to verify if the setD method sets up the value as expected in the Product entity.
Details:
  TestName: testSetDFunctionality
  Description: This test is to verify that the setD method of the Product entity successfully stores the provided integer value to the 'd' variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Product entity and an integer value that will be set to 'd'.
  Act: Invoke the setD method with the initialized integer value as parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the product of 'a' and 'b' minus the product of the integer value and 'd' returns zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setD function has correctly stored the provided integer value to the 'd' variable in the Product entity. This functionality is necessary for the proper calculation of the getDifference method, which in turns affects the overall functional correctness of the application.
Scenario 2: Test to evaluate the impact of setting a negative integer value to the setD method.
Details:
  TestName: testSetDNegativeInteger
  Description: This test checks how the setD method handles a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Product entity and a negative integer that will be set to 'd'.
  Act: Invoke the setD method with the negative integer value as parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the product of 'a' and 'b' minus the product of the negative integer value and 'd' returns a positive value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setD function can handle negative integer values effectively and that the negative integer value adoption inside the 'd' variable in Product entity which further affects the computation in getDifference method. Thus, the significance of this test lies in checking the robustness of the method towards a negative input.
Scenario 3: Test to evaluate the handling of zero value input in the method setD.
Details:
  TestName: testSetDZeroValue
  Description: This test checks how the setD method handles zero value, whether it sets the 'd' variable to zero successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Product entity and set integer value zero that will be set to 'd'.
  Act: Invoke the method setD with zero as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the product of 'a' and 'b' minus the product of zero (the 'd' value) and 'd' equals the product of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the 'd' variable is successfully set to zero, hence when calculating the getDifference method it won't affect the result. This goes to show the correct adaptation of the method towards a zero input.
