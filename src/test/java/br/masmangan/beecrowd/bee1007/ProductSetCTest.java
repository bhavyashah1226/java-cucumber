"""
Scenario 1: Setting Positive Integer Test
Details:
  TestName: setCPositiveInteger
  Description: The test is to check whether the method setC can set positive integers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Invoke setC with a positive integer.
  Assert: Use getDifference method to compare if the set value is functioning correctly on the operation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that setC method can correctly take positive integers and affect the getDifference operation as expected. A correctly functioning setC is central to the correct operation of the application.
Scenario 2: Setting Negative Integer Test
Details:
  TestName: setCNegativeInteger
  Description: The test is to check whether the method setC can set negative integers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Invoke setC with a negative integer.
  Assert: Use getDifference method to compare if the set value is functioning correctly on the operation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that setC method can correctly handle negative integers and affect the getDifference operation as expected. A correctly functioning setC is crucial for the accuracy of the operations.
Scenario 3: Zero Set Test
Details:
  TestName: setCZero
  Description: The test is to check whether the method setC can handle zero as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Invoke setC with zero.
  Assert: Use getDifference method to compare if the set value is functioning correctly on the operation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setC method can handle zero. Setting setC to zero should allow the output of the getDifference operation to be determined purely by the values of a, b and d.
Scenario 4: Large Number Test
Details:
  TestName: setCLargeNumber
  Description: The test is to check whether the method setC can handle large number inputs without errors or performance degradation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Invoke setC with a large number test input.
  Assert: Use getDifference method to check if the set value is functioning correctly on the operation.
Validation:
  The test aims to verify that the setC method can handle large numbers while maintaining accuracy and performance of operations. Therefore, it is important to verify that the code is robust under all possible values of setC within the limits of an integer.
